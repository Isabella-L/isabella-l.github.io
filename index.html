      Compelled by intense peer pressure to have a personal website.
      Urgently in need of a sense of secerity when filling up the "website" column in resume template.
      So here I am, finally ate that frog and set it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      KISS is all I need.

    <h2>
      Seriously now,
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am a year 3 computer engineering student at National University of Singapore. 
      I spent most of my time in robotics, specifically at The Bumblebee. 
      We build autonomous submarines and surface vessels, its pretty cool, you should 
      <a href="https://bumblebee.sg/">check it out</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mostly, I am still trying to find a place in the world. 
      You know about undergrads, we have a lot of dreams but much less experiences. 
      A little more research & development stuff is what I am looking for at the moment.
    <p> 
      By the way, I am in the midst of a 6-month internship with Airbus.
      If you talk to me about it, you will realise how much I like the 
      <a href="https://aircraft.airbus.com/en/aircraft/freighters/belugaxl">Belugas</a>. 
      They are just amazing!

  <h2> Future Plan for this website...</h2>
  <p> 
    Right now I am commiting minimum effort for this website. It is hosted on github pages. 
  </p>
  <p>
    But I see the potentional of it as a side-project. So yeah, wait for me to slowly upgrade this page graphically.

  <p> There you go, this is all about me. </p>
