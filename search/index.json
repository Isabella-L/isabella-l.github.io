[{"content":"I used to hear people say Singapore produces “bilingual talents.”\nI\u0026rsquo;m nore sure I fully agree. Most people are fine at passing their mother-tongue exams (actually, many of them struggle), but real bilingualism is something very different.\nFor me, Chinese is my native language, and I started learning English since as early as I could remeber. I spent half of my life in a Chinese-speaking country, and the other half in an English-speaking one.\nStill, it is quite difficult. And I learnt it when I tried translating.\nIt started with Wait But Why. I was obsessed with the blog. The writer had this strange mix of humour and depth, and I there is a lack of similar contents on the Chinese Internet. So I reached out to the corresponder on Wechat and tried to translate it. I thought it would be straightforward, maybe even helping me with my General Paper.\nIt turns out: very hard.\nI was still in high school and had no training. Long paragraphs felt endless. I’d stare at one sentence for half an hour because there was no perfect way to say it. After a while, I realized translation isn’t a natural talent you just have \u0026ndash; it’s a skill you build. The patience part was real.\nLater, I discovered the TED Translator program, and that made things more fun.\nI translated the Chinese subtitles for this and other videos.\nIt was on a platform called Amara. All TED videos like TED talks, TED-Ed, TEDx are transcribed and translated by volunteers, we bid for videos and translate the subtitles. They were then reviewed by more experienced volunteers. TED talks had just exploded in popularity back then, so it felt very meaningful.\nUnfortunately, they moved away from the Amara platform and adopted a new one. I never learnt to use it. Translation became just one of many side explorations. But the curiosity lingered. For a brief period, I even considered a translation minor, and took TRA2101 Basic Translation and audited a Interpretation course. Both were surprisingly helpful.\nEventually, school stress took over and I drifted away from it.\nBut someday I will pick it up again. I am pretty sure.\n","date":"2025-11-26T22:57:49+08:00","permalink":"https://demo.stack.jimmycai.com/p/random-notes-on-translation/","title":"Random Notes on Translation"},{"content":"Overview of Attack Methodology $$ \\left\\lVert f_\\theta(v + \\delta, l) - y^\\text{true} \\right\\rVert_2 \\ge \\tau,\\quad \\mathcal{D}(v, v + \\delta) \\le \\varepsilon $$\nHere we see two objectives defined:\nThe attack objective $ \\left\\lVert f_\\theta(v + \\delta, l) - y^\\text{true} \\right\\rVert_2 \\ge \\tau, $\nThe Stealth objective $ \\mathcal{D}(v, v + \\delta) \\le \\varepsilon$\nEach objective are assigned with a threshold to define training optimal.\nThey are trained in an alternative optimization algorithm inspired by SPAA, the algorithm is heavily altered to adapted to the adversarial need of VLA attacker.\nTo understand more, you can check out my presentation or contact me at lusicheng@u.nus.edu\nSimulation Experiment Result UPL is applied to the LIBERO Spatial Suite, showing task failure due to discrepancy in action\nd_thr = 15 p_thr = 0.3 Supplementary Training Information Report Photo with my senior My supervisor Prof Shao assigned one of his all mighty PhD to provide some support.
